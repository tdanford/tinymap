# tinymap 

Experimenting with rewriting the core of the minimap2 aligner, in Python.  

Additional bonus points for using DataFrames from either Apache Data Fusion or Pandas.  

This is an experimental project!  Mostly I'm just trying to work through the internals of a "modern" aligner, and not depend on the somewhat-difficult-to-read C code of the original.
